*** Build Instructions for GeoDa 1.5.x ***
******************************************

Overview: We assume the build machine hosts a recently-installed
clean OS.  This build guide contains notes on setting up the compile
environment, obtaining the GeoDa source files and dependent libraries,
compiling libraries and GeoDa, and finally packaging the program
for distribution and installation.

Please consult the readme.txt file located in each platform
subirectory in BuildTools for full build instructions for
each platform.
